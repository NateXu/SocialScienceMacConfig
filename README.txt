This is the repository for a list that Jeff Gill (http://artsci.wustl.edu/~jgill) and Jake Bowers (http://jakebowers.org) have created to help social scientists set up their OS X machines for quantitative, data analytic work.

There is also a list for Linux machines, available here: https://github.com/jabranham/SocialScienceLinuxConfig
