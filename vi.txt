Getting the most from vi/vim.

1. Add vi key bindings to any readline using application (bash, interactive R,
etc.) by adding `set -o vi` to your ~/.profile file.

2. If you have to (or even want to) use Emacs, turn on viper mode to get vi
key bindings (M-x viper-mode).

3. If you prefer MacVIM, you can make it your default editor in terminal
applications by adding the following to your .profile:

    export EDITOR='mvim -f -c "au VimLeave <buffer> maca hide:"'

Make sure to install the MacVIM command line utility in File->Preferences.
